# FinOps + CX Dashboard: Turning Cloud Cost Visibility into Customer Trust

An interactive Tableau dashboard that connects **FinOps** (cloud cost governance, optimization, transparency) with **CX** (customer experience, trust, education, and loyalty).

Built with synthetic/anonymized multi-cloud data (AWS + GCP) — PII fully removed.

### Why This Dashboard Matters
In any cloud-heavy business (SaaS, tech platforms, e-commerce, professional services, utilities, fintech, healthcare, education, etc.), customers increasingly ask:

- “Why is my bill so high?”
- “How can I control my spend?”
- “What am I actually paying for?”

When cost transparency is poor, trust erodes → complaints rise → support costs climb → churn accelerates.

This dashboard bridges that gap:
- Shows **budget vs actual spend** across departments/services
- Highlights **variance trends** and anomalies
- Reveals **cost-to-serve** patterns that directly affect pricing, customer education, and satisfaction

### Key Views Included
- **Total Monthly Budget vs Actual Spend** — by department & year  
  (Orange = budget, blue = actual — underspend/overspend clear at a glance)
- **Variance Breakdown** — by department (stacked bars for yearly comparison)
- **Variance % Heatmap** — red = high negative variance (quick anomaly spotting)
- **Top Cost Drivers** — pie/treemap for fast identification of biggest spenders

### Business Benefits (Any Industry)
- **Customer Education & Trust**  
  Use spend breakdowns to create proactive bill explanations, usage dashboards, and cost-saving recommendations → reduce bill shock → fewer support tickets → higher CSAT/NPS

- **Pricing & Packaging Strategy**  
  See real cost-to-serve per segment → inform usage-based pricing, tiered plans, or value-based packaging → improve margins without alienating customers

- **Proactive CX Programs**  
  Identify high-spend patterns → launch targeted education/outreach (e.g., optimization tips, rebates, efficiency incentives) → lower usage → lower costs → happier customers

- **Cross-Functional Alignment**  
  Finance sees cost drivers, CX sees customer impact, Ops sees optimization opportunities — one shared view reduces silos

- **Margin Protection & Growth**  
  Spot leaks early → reallocate savings to CX investments (better support, personalization, self-service tools) → virtuous cycle of loyalty and efficiency
