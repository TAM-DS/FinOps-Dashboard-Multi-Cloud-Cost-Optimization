# FinOps Dashboard: CX-Driven Multi-Cloud Cost Optimization

**Executive FinOps dashboard demonstrating how infrastructure optimization funds customer experience innovation**

## The CX Connection

$5.4M in cloud infrastructure savings over 24 months—not through cost cutting, but through strategic optimization that freed up capital for customer-facing innovation.

### Business Impact
- **$5.4M saved** over 24 months (59% cost reduction)
- **$1M+ annual savings** in Data Science ML workloads
- **Reinvested in CX initiatives:** AI-powered features, faster experiences, better personalization
- **Zero customer-facing SLA degradation** during optimization
- **41% sustained efficiency** across all departments

### The AI FinOps Story

AI workloads represent 30%+ of cloud spend. Data Science achieved $1M+ in savings while maintaining cutting-edge ML capabilities:

- Multi-cloud GPU placement (AWS + GCP)
- Spot instances for training (60% cost reduction)
- Reserved capacity for customer-facing inference
- Right-sizing based on actual utilization

**Result:** Freed up budget for CX-focused AI features while optimizing infrastructure costs.

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Cloud Strategy
- **AWS:** General compute, storage, and traditional workloads
- **GCP:** BigQuery analytics, specialized ML workloads, TPU access
- Strategic workload placement based on price/performance analysis

### Key Optimizations
1. **Reserved Instance Management:** 40-60% savings on predictable workloads
2. **Spot Instance Strategy:** Training jobs on interruptible capacity
3. **Right-Sizing Program:** Continuous monitoring and automated recommendations
4. **Environment Optimization:** Dev/test resources scaled to actual usage
5. **Waste Elimination:** Orphaned resources, unused volumes, stale snapshots
